# Source Code

### **Map every component to a repository**

Every deployable piece of code should be stored in it’s own repository that follows the naming convention for that component.

### **Git hooks examples setup in all repos**

Setup pre-commit git hooks straight away and symlink them to the root of your repo so people can easily find them and add to them. Add some pre-commit tests to prevent the crawl which is committing your code and it failing due to a simple syntax error or similar.

### **README.md’s written explaining the project**

### **Project icon added**

### **Integrate with Slack**

### **Setup Keys**

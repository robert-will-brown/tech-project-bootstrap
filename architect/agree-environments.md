# Environments

This discussion is often missed early on. Again this doesnâ€™t need to be 100% correct at this point, but everyone knowing that you intend to have your developers develop locally on laptops and then push straight up to a production environment, or if you are going to have ephemeral dev, stage, UAT and production environments with automated deployments of infrastructure triggered by code changes is an important difference!

Understanding your options here and choosing a path now, means that your branching strategy will be easier to define.

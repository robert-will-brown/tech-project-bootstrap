# Diagrams

**Create & share diagram\(s\)**  
At a minimum the High-Level architecture and Environments should be captured in a diagraming tool at this point. It’s not okay to continue with memory and whiteboard scribbles as its surprising how quickly everyones idea of the environment will deviate from this point in.

Choose a tool that’s viewable by everyone. If you are using Visio or similar that outputs files, consider committing those files to a source code repository. This has the advantage over a shared file of being able to be “pipelined” so the entire team can be notified of an update to the diagrams.

Extra credit if your pipeline can generate a PDF from the diagrams and push that to your collaboration hub. Obvious benefits to this is that it’s highly visible to everyone in the team with no specialised tools to hand.

An updated diagram should be kept on or near the information radiator. Always ensure that it is up to date. Discussions that benefit from an overview of the platform can simply walk up to the information radiator and use the diagrams to ensure accurate understanding. This only works if people know it’s up to date. Low friction is key here: if your documents are kept in a source code repository then a pipeline that can check them out on change and send them to a printer situated near to the information repository makes it effortless to just pick it off the printer and blu tac it in place.

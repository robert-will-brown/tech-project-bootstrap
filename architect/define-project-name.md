# Project name

I’ve been involved in a few projects that didn’t have a name. Or the name slightly different depending on who was asked in the project team. This is a recipe for confusion and extra work straight off. Without a consistent project name automating even the most basic task will be a frustrating and unreliable endeavour. The project name will be used almost immediately in the project lifecycle to name cloud environments, prepend to server names, used as database names, provide access in ldap/ad, used to tag resources, source code repositories, folder structures, metric names, storage buckets, prepend to meeting appointments and subject lines in emails and filenames for the project plan to name just a few.

If there isn’t an agreed internal name for the project a great way to move on quickly is to assign it a codename. Codenames have the benefit that it can be chosen by the team without any interaction with management or marketing. The team picking the name also gives a sense of ownership of the project to them.

The codename can live for the entire lifecycle of the project and makes it easy for the service to be rebranded if the business requires without it causing a legacy of mismatched names at the technical level. And if the requirement should ever come to have to change the name, searching and replacing a single codename will prove much easier.

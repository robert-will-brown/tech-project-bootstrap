# Backlog

The backlog will store all of the tasks. It should be integrated where necessary with your collaboration hub, and everyone should be able to access and add backlog issues.

My preference is to view the tasks in a Kanaban style tool which enables the easy tracking of tasks. For some reason having a tool which lets you drag and drop your tasks between various states seems to empower the team to update the status with less badgering than updating an individual ticket without the ability to conceptualise where it sits in the greater chain of events.

Having this available for the whole team to see at the Information radiator is a plus.

Allowing users to add tasks in the simplest possible way, with as fewer key strokes as possible and without having to add all of the data makes it more likely that all required tasks will be captured. This comes at the expense of increased effort for the team lead to ensure that these tasks get fleshed out in a timely fashion, however the trade off is worth it. An example is a security group that is opened up temporarily to ensure it isn’t the cause of an issue. If the tasks to secure the security group isn’t captured immediately then it could be forgotten and captured at best in the next security scan, and at worst when a hacker dumps your user database on the internet. A reminder that can be created in a couple of clicks and can then be picked up by anyone and fixed when appropriate. If the tools is complex and slow to use the temptation is to try to remember to close down that security group, which won’t allways work.

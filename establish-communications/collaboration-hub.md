# Collaboration hub

A collaboration hub is the tool used to do the majority of communicating outside of face to face. Typically this is slack, ms teams, rocketchat etc. Tools that people can't setup their own rooms in, or tools that don't allow easy copy and pasting of code, images, etc should be avoided like the plague. Once development starts at pace, the simple ability to paste a screenshot to the entire team easily is a simple but massive boon to productivity.

Ensure that people know how to write code snippets in the tool. Dropping code in that the tool thinks is text makes reading it and copying it back out frought with errors as hidden control characters break config files in non-obvious ways.

Choosing a tool that isn’t easy to integrate with is a mistake. The benefit of these tools outside of human -&gt; human interaction and into computer -&gt; team interaction shouldn’t be underestimated. Easy integrations where plenty of people have done it before are key to this, low friction gets stuff done.

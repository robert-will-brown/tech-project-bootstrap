# Information radiator

This, this, this.

If there’s one thing \(standup aside\) that can focus a group it’s the information radiator. There’s a reason for dashboards in cars, instrument panels in planes and the bridge of the starship enterprise. Everyone can get together when somethings going wrong and see the same set of information. It will improve the chances of making good decisions to fix the problem.

Information radiators should be visible to everyone in the team when they are together \(with the minimum knock straining\), and also available over http for those that are remote working and for checking on your mobile whilst toasting a successful sprint down the pub.

Information radiators are for a mix of information. Project and technical. SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO PUT ON IT SUGGEST THAT

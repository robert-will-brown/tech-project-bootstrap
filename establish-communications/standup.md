# Standup

The standup is the most important communication tool available to projects. Zero cost, little effort, and suddenly everyone is working on the same page. Setup the meeting as the first task to ensure immediate communications and set the tone for the project, even if there is little to initially discuss. Stick to 15 mins, aggressively offline inappropriate conversation, and always start on time. If there is one time to crack the whip and enforce discipline in a project its in the timely attendance to the standup. Make it an LME \(low mental exercise\) by setting a consistent time and place for the meeting that doesn’t change. If some people have to dial in prefer that video conferencing is used \(seeing their faces is crucial\).

And please, its called standup for a reason, standup! even if you're on the end of video conference. It will be over quicker.

The format or agenda of a standup can vary, I’m not a fan of going through the backlog in the meeting but having it on the Information radiator to hand is a definite bonus.

# Give everything clear, concise names

Once the outline of the high level architect and associated technologies has been firmed up, and itâ€™s known what environments you are going to choose, you should give everything a name.

Everything.

Automation depends on this, sanity of the team depends on this.

Prepending the project/codename and environment \(now they have been given\) is vital as you will probably have several instances of these systems deployed at any one time. Telling the difference clearly between them \(2am test\) could mean the difference between deleting the dev environment and deleting production \(in reality safeguards should be in place but you get my point\).

CodeName-Environment-Resource.

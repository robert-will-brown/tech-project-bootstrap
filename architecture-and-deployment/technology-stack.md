# Technology stack

On a large project the idea of being able to define the full tech stack up front is optimistic. But effort should be given at the point to white board up the entire end to end solution and drill into each component refining the technology to be used.

It’s not uncommon for certain components to be add or changed, as the project matures and you shouldn’t be concerned with that happening. The effort at this time is to understand your teams abilities and skill levels vs the technology you hope to use. Solutions Architects, myself included, will often gravitate towards the latest technology released only a few months before. This is generally positive, but care should be taken to ensure that the operations and development teams can support and effectively work with the technology proposed.

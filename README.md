# Introduction
    
Boot strapping and running technology projects to deliver great outcomes for customers takes experience.  There are a lot of skills, many of them soft as well as technical to master before a project can be run nearly effortlessly.

I’ve never managed the effortless part.

That being said I have learned a lot from a whole bunch of great people that I’ve tried to employ on every project I now run, which improves the likelihood of a great outcome.  

The following “guide” is meant as an aide memoir to myself to make sure I follow my own advice and implement these learnings in a structured way.
